There's the shopping list you make before you go to Trader Joe's—the stuff your pantry actually needs, like bananas, eggs, bread, and so on. And then there are the items that call to you from the aisles, that catch your eye and draw you toward them. The newly released snack that you just have to try. The cult favorites you can't resist.

</section>
<section>
You'll probably find them among the items listed here. There are seasonal faves (buy them in bulk, they may disappear soon!) and some newer products that are already enjoying major fandom. Think dark chocolate peanut butter cups (stash these in your freezer), ready-made Mandarin chicken (which shoppers named their favorite Trader Joe's product in 2021), and Everything but the Bagel seasoning (which makes everything smell like an NYC bagel shop).

</section>
<section>
For this list of the best Trader Joe's items, we asked Delish editors for their favorite products and scoured the internet for the products that everyone is raving about. Despite the long check-out lines and crazy parking lots, here are the products people keep coming back for.

<h2>Our Top Ten BestSellers</h2>

<ul>

<p>
1
<li>Dark Chocolate Peanut Butter Cups</li>
Peanut butter and chocolate are a dynamic duo that withstand the test of time, but when it's dark chocolate—boy, does this combo taste even better. Trader Joe's dark chocolate peanut butter cups are such a fan-favorite item that they won the Sweet Treat title in the 2021 Annual Customer Choice Awards released by Trader Joe's.

</p>
<p>

2
<li>Teeny Tiny Avocados</li>
There's nothing worse than saving an unused avocado half in the fridge only for it to go bad seemingly minutes later. Thankfully, Trader Joe's has an adorably small solution. These single serving avocados are the perfect size for adding to sandwiches, salads, and just about anything else. You'll never have to waste an avocado again.

</p>
<p>
everything but the leftovers seasoningTrader Joe's
3
<li>Everything But The Leftovers Seasoning Blend</li>
This seasoning had me at "everything but." If it's even half as good as TJ's Everything But The Bagel Seasoning, it's sure to become a pantry staple–especially around Thanksgiving. The mix has dehydrated onion, sea salt, turmeric powder, rosemary, thyme, sage, and more. Add it to your leftovers to make your meal even better the second time around. "It's like Thanksgiving in a jar," this reviewer wrote.

</p>
<p>

trader joe's stir fried garlicky cabbageTrader Joe's
4
<li>Stir Fried Garlicky Cabbage</li>
This frozen vegetable side is a newcomer to TJ's, but it's already secured a spot as one of the best products they've ever released. The savory soy glaze and sliced garlic dresses up the humble cabbage for a delightfully filling dish.

</p>
<p>

5
<li>Lemony Arugula Basil Salad Kit</li>
"I literally run to the salad section to make sure that they have this," this TikTok creator said. "It's the vinaigrette. It's only in the salad kit. Y'all, this with a piece of salmon on the side, bussin'!"


</p>
<p>
6
<li>Mediterranean Style Hummus</li>
hummusTrader Joe's
Trader Joe's offers plenty of different hummus varieties—from Everything Bagel to even chocolate—but the classic Mediterranean Style Hummus is the OG for a reason. It's rich, creamy, and smooth on its own, but the drizzle of olive oil, pine nuts, and herbs makes each bite extra luxe.


</p>
<p>

green goddess seasoning blendTrader Joe's
7
<li>Green Goddess Seasoning Blend</li>
TJ's has its seasoning blends down. And turning its super popular green goddess dressing into something you can shake onto everything? Genius. "I am hooked on this seasoning for avocado toast," a reviewer wrote. "The lemon flavor gives it such a good kick. I accidentally used this when I couldn’t find my everything seasoning, and it’s so good I may never go back."

</p>
<p>
8
<li>Unexpected Cheddar Cheese</li>
cheddarTrader Joe's
"Year in, year out, Trader Joe’s Unexpected Cheddar is one of their best selling products," the blog Trader Joe's Rants writes. "It’s a knock-it-out-of-the-ballpark item. If you put this out on a cheese plate for company you are almost guaranteed to get, 'Wow, this cheese is amazing. Where did you get it?'"

</p>
<p>
garlic achaar sauceTrader Joe's
9
<li>Garlic Achaar Sauce</li>
Trader Joe's is our go-to for easy weeknight dinners. This spiced sauce can top rice or chicken, or be enjoyed alongside soups or hamburgers. It's the condiment of your dreams. "For $2.69, it's a really solid and tasty item as long as you enjoy the spices of Indian food," Brenda Sickles of Become Betty wrote. "This condiment is a truly blank canvas that will allow you to get creative with something that seems a bit plain."

</p>
<p>

10
<li>French Onion Macaroni & Cheese</li>
macTrader Joe's
When you combine two of our favorite comfort foods, you can't possibly go wrong. This mac and cheese is inspired by the French bistro classic by incorporating Swiss cheese, sweet roasted onions, and a sprinkling of crunchy croutons. Each bite is deliciously indulgent.
</p>




<h2>Delightful Array of Ten Delicious Goodies</h2>
<p>

11
<li>Creamy Cauliflower Jalapeño Dip</li>
We're pretty much always looking for a new low-carb dip (and new, interesting ways to use cauliflower!) and this Creamy Cauliflower Jalapeño Dip is a spicy, creamy, dreamy addition to our fridges.

</p>
<p>


12
<li>Soft & Juicy Mango</li>
Dried fruit can sometimes get a bad rap, but TJ's sweetened mango slices are almost like candy. They're tender and still retain some moisture so you won't need to chew for hours. And the light sprinkle of sugar on the outside is an added bonus.

</p>
<p>

    <li>Slingshot</li>
Laurence Fishburne and Casey Affleck star in this psychological thriller about an astronaut struggling to keep his grip on reality during a...




13
<li>Jicama Wraps</li>
If you're looking for a low-carb swap for taco night that does not have the word "cauliflower" in it, these jicama wraps are the perfect solution. They're thinly sliced, crunchy, and delicious enough that you'll barely miss the carb of a tortilla. Plus, they are a keto lover's best friend.


</p>
<p>
14
<li>Organic Orange Juice</li>
ojTrader Joe's
If you like starting your morning with something sweet or need a mixer for your mimosas, Trader Joe's cold pressed orange juice is a must grab. Compared to other store-bought bottles, their version tastes so fresh and almost as if it was freshly squeezed into your glass.

</p>
<p>

15
<li>Pork & Ginger Soup Dumplings</li>
No need to order takeout with these pork and ginger soup dumplings from Trader Joe's around. They can be found in the frozen section and when heated up, are filled with a warm, savory broth along with a meat filling. "Get these from Trader Joe's right now!" this Tiktoker raved.

</p>
<p>


16
<li>Chipotle Vegetable Quesadillas</li>
These frozen quesadillas are a favorite of Delish's associate editor Gabby Romero. "The tortillas are so soft and fluffy," she says. "And I love how the corn and black beans add some extra heft." They're delicious on their own, but topping it with some guacamole never hurts.

</p>
<p>

17
<li>Green Goddess Dip</li>
If you struggle to get your veggies in, look no further than this Green Goddess Dip, a spin on the popular green goddess dressing. "The sour cream adds a little body and zip, and the mayo definitely helps thicken stuff up a bit," the blog What's Good at Trader Joe's wrote. "Other than that, the dips has all the hallmarks: citrusy, garlicky, acidic, a touch spicy but in a flavorful, not heated kinda way.


</p>
<p>

18
<li>Daily Facial Sunscreen</li>
Trader Joe's may be known for its food products, but you shouldn't sleep on the skincare. This sunscreen has gone viral for being a dupe for the $37 Supergoop Unseen Sunscreen. At only $9, you can protect your skin and your wallet.


</p>
<p>


19
<li>Cold Brew Coffee Concentrate</li>
If you are a cold brew lover, you have to try the concentrate from TJ's. "I love this stuff!" this reviewer wrote. "A little goes away as it is concentrated, and it is strong. I'm addicted to this stuff. Easy to use and much cheaper than buying cold brew all the time."


</p>
<p>

20
<li>Hold the Cone Ice Cream Cones</li>
A mini dessert? We love it! "The Trader Joe’s Chocolate Hold the Cone! Mini Ice Cream Cones are as delicious as they are fun to eat," the blog Freezer Meal Frenzy wrote. "They’re loaded with chocolatey flavor and packed into small-sized cones that are delightful to eat. If you’re on the fence about picking up a batch of these, we definitely think you should go for it!"

</p>



<h2>Ten Magical Delectables</h2>

<p>

21
<li>Carne Asada</li>
We love TJ's for their pre-made meals, but this carne asada, all ready to go on the grill, will make you feel like you put in the work without taking up too much of your time. "I’ve eaten a lot of carne asada in my day, and not all of it has been good, but TJ’s was definitely one of my top fives," Brandi of Hip2keto wrote. "And when I can get it even cheaper than buying the ingredients separately, you’d best believe this forgetful meal planner is keeping it on hand in case of dinner emergencies!"

</p>
<p>


22
<li>Tiramisu Torte</li>
Tiramisu is undoubtedly delicious, but whipping one up isn't exactly quick. The time you spend on could be time with your guests at your next ~fancy dinner party~! Instead, try picking one of these up at Trader Joe's. Stick it in the fridge while you cook, and it'll be perfect by dessert.

</p>
<p>

23
<li>Rosemary Croissant Croutons</li>
Let's be real: the best part of any salad is the delightful, carby crunch of a crouton. And these buttery bites are the best croutons at Trader Joe's—and probably the best croutons period. The flaky layers of the classic pastry lend a crisp texture that's way more luxurious than just a hunk of stale bread.

</p>
<p>

24
<li>Portuguese Custard Tarts</li>
Pastéis de nata is a beloved Portuguese dessert that's best described as if a crème brûlée and a croissant had a baby. Trader Joe's has a frozen version of the rich, buttery treat that they import straight from Portugal. These are a favorite for our associate culinary producer Justin Sullivan.

</p>
<p>



25
<li>Pumpkin Butter</li>
Trader Joe's ICONIC Pumpkin Butter may only be around during the fall, but when we do have it, we couldn't be more excited to spread it on E-V-E-R-Y-T-H-I-N-G. The 10-ounce jars are also only $2.29, so we always make sure to stock up to last us the entire year. "To be honest, there’s a good chance you’ll probably end up eating this out of the jar, standing over your counter with a spoon in hand," the blog Trader Joe's grocery reviews wrote.

</p>
<p>

26
<li>Italian Bomba Hot Pepper Sauce</li>
Want to recreate Carbone's iconic spicy vodka sauce at home? It starts with fermented Calabrian chili peppers, which have a uniquely fruity, funky, and savory spice. The Trader Joe's version packs a punch without being too spicy, so you'll want to add it to every plate of pasta and every slice of pizza.

</p>
<p>
 
27
<li>Mac And Cheese Bites</li>
After leaving stores for a short time due to a supplier issue, Trader Joe's finally reintroduced its famous Mac and Cheese Bites. They're stuffed with seven types of cheese. SEVEN. Count 'em with us: cheddar, havarti, Swiss, gouda, cream cheese, Monterey Jack, and pecorino Romano. "They come in a small package and are something fun to always have on hand," Tanya of The Top Meal wrote. "Plus they are relatively inexpensive. These bites are a cheese-lovers dream appetizer or snack."

</p>
<p>



28
<li>Sweet Corn, Burrata, & Basil Ravioli</li>
Trader Joe's launched these seasonal ravioli—stuffed with sweet corn, burrata, and basil—summers ago, but they remain a shopper favorite. The pasta's biggest fans recommend keeping the sauce simple: just some butter and fresh-cracked pepper. "There are little corn kernels in there that add a little hint of sweetness, which I loved," this Redditor wrote. "Usually the ravioli at TJ’s are pretty flat and empty, but these were appropriately stuffed. I just added red pepper flakes to this with no sauce and loved it!


</p>
<p>


29
<li>Everything but the Bagel Seasoned Smoked Salmon</li>
Trader Joe's finally did with their prolific Everything but the Bagel seasoning what fans have been doing for years: Added it to prepackaged, presliced smoked salmon. "The seasonings add a nice top note to the mild farm raised salmon which has a nice buttery texture," the blog Trader Joe's Rants wrote. "So delicious and totally satisfying."


</p>
<p>


30
<li>Outside-In Stuffed Gnocchi</li>
When we first spotted these, we knew we had to try them. What could be better than soft pillows STUFFED with cheese?! "It’s less like a pasta dish and more like a healthier, more substantial take on pizza rolls," the blog Freezer Meal Frenzy wrote. "The dough-like texture makes this feel different from ravioli or other types of stuffed pasta; it’s almost like a gourmet restaurant decided to serve pizza pockets to its guests."


</p>


<h2>Another Ten Treats</h2>

<p>




31
<li>Cauliflower Pizza Crust</li>
This favorite among the gluten-free community is a perfect "mild flavored crust that Trader Joe’s has so kindly made for us," Ashley Spence of CookItHealthier wrote. "[It] is the perfect foundation in which to build your pizza upon because it doesn’t have any 'built in' strong flavors."


</p>
<p>


32
<li>Corn And Chile Tomato-Less Salsa</li>
There's pretty much nothing this salsa doesn't go with: chips, burgers, hot dogs, fish, salad ... need we continue? "I like tossing shrimp or ceviche in this salsa since the sweetness and the corn provide a really nice counter balance to seafood," Trader Joe's Grocery Reviews wrote. "This stuff is definitely addictive, so if you think you’ll just dip a few chips in this and put it back in the refrigerator, you would be wrong. "


</p>
<p>


33
<li>Kung Pao Tempura Cauliflower</li>
"[I] love the Kung Pao Tempura Cauliflower!" Mackenzie Filson, assistant digital food producer, said. "[I] have even tossed it with Buffalo sauce when needing a change up."


</p>
<p>




34
<li>Cauliflower Gnocchi</li>
Shop before noon if you want even half a chance of finding these in stock. And don't follow the cooking directions on the back of the bag: Just toss them right into a pan with olive oil or butter.


</p>
<p>


35
<li>Everything But The Bagel Seasoning Blend</li>
TJ's regulars went BONKERS for this when it came out, and now it's a staple in most shoppers' spice cabinets. "I cannot live without Everything but the Bagel seasoning," Sarah Ceniceros, senior designer, said. "I put it on my avocado toast every morning and buy it in bulk."


</p>
<p>


36
<li>Peanut Butter Filled Pretzels</li>
Honestly, have you ever made it through the snack aisle without picking these up? "The pretzels are the best I have ever eaten," this reviewer wrote. "Almost melt in your mouth!"


</p>
<p>




37
<li>Mandarin Orange Chicken</li>
"The chicken is phenomenal," Freezer Meal Frenzy wrote. "Because of the pan-cooked method, it ends up just a little bit crispy on the outside, which is absolutely perfect for an Asian chicken dish. And the sauce complements the chicken very well."


</p>
<p>


38
<li>Crispy, Crunchy, Mochi Rice Nuggets</li>
"These crispy crunchy mochi rice nuggets were something I was obsessed with for a while," Philip Swift, senior post-production supervisor, said. "I would buy half a dozen bags at a time and plow through them in two days. So addictive and wonderful in a way I would never have believed."


</p>
<p>


39
<li>Chicken Tikka Masala</li>
This is the frozen aisle favorite at Delish—don't you agree? "[I] would eat every day if socially acceptable," Lindsey Ramsey, director of content operations, said. "Perfect portion size, cheap, and consistently delicious."


</p>
<p>




40
<li>Speculoos Cookie Butter</li>
There are a lot of ways to eat this cookie butter, but this recommendation from the Fearless Flyer is best: "Keep it really simple and just use it as a dip for a spoon.""It tastes great!" Club Trader Joe's wrote. "It has hints of the spices added, cinnamon and nutmeg."


</p>


<h2>Food is an Experience</h2>


<p>


41
<li>Gone Bananas!</li>
Guess what? These are the best-selling frozen treat OF ALL TIME at Trader Joe's. "They are definitely really addictive, and because the bag is only 8 ounces, I can easily eat the entire bag in 10 minutes!" the blog Trader Joe's Grocery Reviews wrote. "Maybe not the best way to do it, but you should definitely keep a box of these in your freezer for when you feel like a bit of an indulgence."


</p>
<p>


42
<li>Joe-Joe's Chocolate Vanilla Creme Cookies</li>
Oreos ... but from Trader Joe's ... so they're better. "These cookies are so damn good. My whole family loves them," this reviewer wrote. "They are rich so I can only easy 1-2 which is a good thing and they always curb my sugar craving."


</p>
<p>


43
<li>Baked Cheese Crunchies</li>
For the people in the back: THESE SNACKS HAVE 33 PERCENT LESS FAT THAN REGULAR CHEESE-FLAVORED CORN SNACKS. "It doesn’t have that artificial spike in flavor that Cheetos do and is a lot gentler in its junk food vibe," one of our editors says. "It’s less salty, the cheesiness is milkier tasting, and its crunch is less explosive."


</p>
<p>


44
<li>Vegan Kale, Cashew, And Basil Pesto</li>
The tub says "vegan," but this isn't just a fan-fave amongst veg-heads. Even meat eaters can't get enough. "A little goes a long way with this pesto," this reviewer said. "It’s delicious. I’ve used it on pizza dough, in a pasta sauce, mixed with a vegan Alfredo sauce, on bread, etc. Nothing is lacking from this pesto. Packed with flavor, fullness, freshness, and salty deliciousness."


</p>
<p>


45
<li>Vegan Mozzarella Style Shreds</li>
Dairy-free TJ's shoppers love this because it melts like actual mozz. "This is a wonderful cheese alternative," a reviewer wrote. "Melts extremely [well] and flavor is very tasty. I’d probably put this in my top 3 favorite vegan cheeses, I used this for a green chili enchilada, and they came out great!"


</p>
<p>


46
<li>Organic Broccoli Slaw</li>
The best part about this undressed slaw is that you can doctor it any which way you please. "This Trader Joe’s broccoli slaw is a good way to get a little crunch in your salad," Trader Joe's Grocery Reviews wrote. "I like having something rich and savory with this since it tends to absorb flavors and is definitely a very neutral tasting salad."


</p>
<p>


47
<li>Mini Brie Bites</li>
Don't feel like cutting open a whole wheel of cheese? "Get yourself a slice of some crusty bread, tear a Brie up, and put that mutha in the toaster oven," this Redditor recommended. "Melty deliciousness."


</p>
<p>


48
<li>Crunchy Chili Onion Peanuts</li>
If you love drizzling savory, spicy chili crisp on just about anything, this snack is for you. This seasoning adds an umami-packed boost to each bite and has a pleasantly slow-building burn. They're delicious on their own or sprinkled on top of stir fries.



</p>
<p>


49
<li>Bamba Peanut Snacks</li>
Imagine if Nutter Butters and Pirate's Booty had a baby. This would be it—and people are OBSESSED. "These Trader Joe’s Bamba peanut snacks are crunchy, oily, and have an amazing taste of peanut butter and salt," Trader Joe's Grocery Reviews wrote.
